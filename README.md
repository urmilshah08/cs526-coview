# CoView

It has been almost a year since the first case of the deadly COVID-19 virus was confirmed in USA. Since then, the virus is responsible for millions of confirmed cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. The goal of CoView is to track and visualize the impact of this pandemic in US. Here, we will visualize how the number of cases and hospitalizations have fluctuated in the past year of the pandemic, as well as how the vaccine administration has helped in the slowing the spread of the disease.

We accomplish this by making sure that our data is full and comes from a reputed source. We are using CovidActNow as the source who is trusted by multiple institutions. CoView is designed for anyone who wants to understand the current situation of the virus in a state, as well as how the virus affected the state since this pandemic started.

The application provides this knowledge by providing choropleth maps for various metrics such as cases, vaccines administered as well as the current risk level in separate tabs. Each tab has a state view of the map where a user can click on a state to get more detail about that state in a timeseries, such as case density, number of deaths as well number of doses administered every day. CoView also has a state tab which goes into more detail about the current vaccination progress by showing % population that is fully vaccinated, doses administered in the last week, as predict how long it will take for a state to reach herd immunity.

Overall, CoView helps visualize how COVID-19 affected and is still affecting the USA, and the progress we have made in combating this disease with vaccinations.
